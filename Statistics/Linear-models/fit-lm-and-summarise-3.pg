#  Main text

BEGIN_PGML

The CSV file linked below has some information about two types of
car sampled from an online used car site. The variables recorded
are asking price (in 1000s of US dollars), mileage (in 1000s of miles),
age (in years),
and car type (Maxima or Accord).

Use these data to fit a model for estimating the asking price from
the age and type of the car, including an interaction term.
Then use your model to answer the questions below.

[@ htmlLink($data_local_url, "Download CSV here.") @]*

What is the model value *in dollars* for the price of a [$age]-year-old
[$carType] with [$milesK],000 miles?

* answer: $[___]{$model_value}{10}

How much would the model value change if the car were an [$otherCarType] instead?
(Use a negative value if the model value would be less, a positive value if
it would be more.)

* difference in model values: $[___]{$model_value_diff}{10}

How much less does this model think the price will be if a
[$carType] of the same age has an additional 10,000 miles?

* answer: $[___]{$decrease_per_10K}{10}

How much less does this model think the price will be if a
[$carType] with the same mileage is an additional year older?

* answer: $[___]{$decrease_per_year}{10}


Compute the following values for this model:

* RSS for this model = [___]{$rss}{10}

* SSM for this model = [___]{$ssm}{10}

* SST for this model = [___]{$sst}{10}

* [`R^2`] for this model = [___]{$rsquared}{10}
